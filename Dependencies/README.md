# Octopus dependencies
The Octopus browser uses a number of external libraries and frameworks to deliver its capabilities. The following list displays every one of them, their choice and license.
## wxWidgets
xwWidgets is a cross-platform GUI framework for C++. It was preferred over an alternative, Qt, for being simpler to maintain, easier to develop for open-source teams and it being focused completely on graphic user interface with no need to include anything the project does not require.
